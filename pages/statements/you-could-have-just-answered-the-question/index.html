	<h1>You could have just answered the question</h1>

	<div class="explanation">
	You've been called out because you had the opportunity to answer the
	question but instead chose to lower the quality of discussion. Consider
	answering the question or just saying nothing. If you feel that there were
	problems with the question itself, consider simply saying that.
